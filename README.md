# Color Detection
An image processing program in Python. This software project is a logic draft of the color detection component in [Let's Dance](https://github.com/KevinSiu1/G15_LetsDance), which is a game implementing video processing technology to program FPGA hardwares in Verilog.
See a full vedio demo of the hardware game [here](https://github.com/KevinSiu1/G15_LetsDance/blob/master/video/video.mp4).
